# Planning Poker
## for Arduboy

This project is Agile Planning Poker implemented as an Arduboy application. Power up the Arduboy, pick your pack under Config, and Start a round of Planning Poker. Each person presses to leave a "vote confirmed" screen into the voting menu. Then they select a choice and pass it on the "vote confirmed" screen. Pass the Arduboy around to each member of the team, then back to the Scrum master, who can press B instead of A on the vote confirmation screen to end the vote and display a final tally.
